# Design and Analysis of Algorithms Coursework

This repo contains programming assignments from Standord's [Algorithms: Design and Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo) course and Robert Sedgewick's [Algorithms](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) textbook.

These scripts, largely written in Java, implement classic algorithms.
